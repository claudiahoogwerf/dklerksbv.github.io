##### Current Offer
consists of ACT coaching (individual) and mindfulness training (individual, group, or digital audio recordings). Sessions can be purchased individually or in packages and can be delivered via video call or face-to-face. If you choose face-to-face sessions, it's important to note that I currently do not have an office space. Therefore, these meetings can either take place in your own home or in a public place. Any travel costs will be discussed and agreed upon together.

An introduction with me is possible prior to the sessions (20 minutes via phone/video call and free with purchase of one of the ACT or mindfulness packages). In support of the ACT and mindfulness packages, I offer a download package of several free guided mindfulness (MF) exercises.

###### Important:
Email, text, or call me before making a purchase so that I can check my availability and guarantee that I can provide the service or product. Also, please read the terms and conditions (especially regarding appointment cancellations and changes).
