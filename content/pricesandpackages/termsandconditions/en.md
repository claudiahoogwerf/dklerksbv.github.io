General Terms and Conditions

Welcome! You want to start a process with Sitting with Yourself (in Dutch: Zitten met Jezelf) or you intend to purchase one of the products. First of all, thank you for your trust! It's great to see that you want to work on yourself, and I will do my best to make you a satisfied customer.
Additionally, it's important that you know your rights and obligations regarding your potential purchase so that you can start well-informed. In this overview, you'll find everything you need to know. I've tried to write this clearly for you (instead of the usual complex sentence structure and jargon often found in general terms and conditions). If you still have trouble understanding the text below, don't hesitate to contact me at info@zittenmetjezelf.nl. Or ask your question during one of our sessions.

How to read this document?
I use the words 'I/me/my', 'you/your', and 'we/us/our' respectively for myself, 'Daniël Klerks', for you 'the user of the product/process', and for us together. If I use the word product, I mean the combination of (digital or analog) files that I offer via zittenmetjezelf.nl, via my own social media (Google, Youtube, Instagram, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, and Email), and via the sessions, training sessions, or courses that I provide. This includes all texts, theories, models, images, videos, and audio fragments created by me, which are visible on the mentioned channels or distributed in paper format. If I use the word program, I mean the conversation (the session), the combination of conversations (sessions), the training sessions, or the courses that I offer via zittenmetjezelf.nl. If you want to purchase or have purchased a product, the information in part 1 and 3 of this document is important for you (1 to 1.2 and 3 to 3.5). If you want to purchase or have purchased a program, the information in part 2 and part 3 of this document is important for you (2 to 3.5).

1. Products of Zitten met Jezelf

The following conditions apply to the products I offer:

1.1 Financial matters
The fee you pay depends on which package you purchase. On zittenmetjezelf.nl under 'Programs & Pricing' you will find an overview with the most up-to-date information about the various packages. If the overview states that a package costs 100 euros, this price includes VAT. When you purchase a product, you pay the rate that is currently on my website (If my rates increase during an ongoing process, I will always inform you to avoid surprises). Payment for a product must be made within 14 days of the invoice date. Invoices and statements are sent electronically by email. After the payment term has expired, I will send a payment reminder and give you the opportunity to pay within 14 days of receiving the reminder. If the payment is still not made after this second payment term has expired, I am entitled to take collection measures or have them carried out by third parties. From the expiration of the second payment term, in addition to the amount you owe me, interest and extrajudicial collection costs will also be charged to you. The interest rate is determined by the statutory interest rate in the Netherlands. I am entitled to unilaterally change the payment terms, but this change will only apply to all purchases you make after the change of payment terms (as indicated on the Zitten met Jezelf website on the Programs & Prices page). For all already purchased products, a refund is only possible in very exceptional circumstances after purchase. Email me at info@zittenmetjezelf.nl if you believe you qualify for a refund and clearly state the reason for your request for a refund. Based on this, I will decide whether you qualify for a refund. I reserve the right to refuse this without giving a reason. I charge a 15 euro administrative fee when I accommodate you.

1.2 Data processing
All our communication is confidential. This means that I will never share personal data with others without your permission. The personal data I receive from you will remain within the (digital) walls of Zitten met Jezelf and within the secure online platforms we use to communicate (Google, Microsoft, Facebook, etc.).













2. Programs of Zitten met Jezelf

The following conditions apply to the programs I offer:

2.1 Duration and frequency of sessions
The length of a session and the number of sessions you are entitled to depend on the package you purchase. On zittenmetjezelf.nl under 'Programs & Pricing' you will find an overview with the most up-to-date information about the various packages. Simply look up the package you purchased and read the information in the column. In practice, you may receive slightly more session time than indicated above, for example, if a session runs over. Don't worry, you won't have to pay extra for this. It also won't detract from the sessions you are still entitled to, unless we agree on this before the session. Sessions cannot be shortened to receive more sessions than the indicated amount in the overview (for example, by halving the sessions in time but doubling the number of sessions). The duration and frequency of the sessions as indicated in the purchased package under 'Programs & Pricing' are binding. If we decide together to change the duration and frequency of the sessions after the purchase, we will put the new agreements in writing, and this new agreement will be binding. The frequency of sessions is determined by the availability of both you and me in our schedules and the expiration date of the package. As the buyer, you are actively responsible for requesting and using sessions on time within the expiration period of the package. If I notice that your term is almost expired and you still have sessions owed, or if you haven't booked sessions for a while, I may send you a reminder. Receiving a reminder is a service and not a right. Not receiving a reminder is not a reason for a refund or other form of compensation. If, due to unforeseen circumstances, it is not possible to use the sessions within the expiration date, we will discuss together what the options are: the expiration date can be adjusted or we decide on a session pause with (partial) refund. See paragraph 2.2 for more information and relevant conditions.

2.2 Financial matters
The fee you pay depends on which package you purchase. On zittenmetjezelf.nl under 'Programs & Pricing', you will find an overview with the most up-to-date information about the various packages. If the overview states that a package costs 1000 euros, this price includes VAT. Please note: this price excludes any travel and preparation costs incurred by me. However, I will always discuss this with you before the process begins, and it only applies if we decide to hold one or more sessions at your home or in a public space of your choice. If the sessions take place online or in a space provided by Zitten met Jezelf, no additional fee will be charged. Travel costs are agreed upon and documented in consultation, as stated on the website. This agreement is binding for calculating the final price of the travel costs. 
	Payments for programs must be made within 14 days of the invoice date. Invoices and statements are sent electronically by email. After the payment term has expired, I will send a payment reminder and give you the opportunity to pay within 14 days of receiving the reminder. If payment is still not made after this second payment term has expired, I am entitled to take collection measures or have them carried out by third parties. From the expiration of the second payment term, in addition to the amount you owe me, interest and extrajudicial collection costs will also be charged to you. The interest rate is determined by the statutory interest rate in the Netherlands. If payment is not made, I will suspend the treatment process until all outstanding payment obligations are fulfilled. I am entitled to unilaterally change the payment terms, but this change will only apply to all purchases you make after the change of payment terms (as indicated on the Zitten met Jezelf website on the Programs & Pricing page). 
	It can always happen that one of us becomes (long-term) unavailable, for example, due to illness or an accident, making it impossible to complete the sessions. In exceptional and unforeseen circumstances, it is possible, in consultation, to receive (partial) refunds for the package you have purchased. The session credit will then be forfeited. Loss of motivation for sessions or a busy schedule are not considered exceptional unforeseen circumstances. I reserve the right to refuse these options without giving a reason.

2.4 My role as a coach and trainer
Although I am certified as a Psychologist, my official role during our conversations is that of Coach and Trainer. It is important to realize that these are not protected titles and that they come with fewer rights and responsibilities than, for example, the title Psychologist within the Mental Health Care (GGZ). For instance, I do not maintain an official file, I am not medically responsible or liable for you, and there are no official rules regarding confidentiality. Additionally, the coaching and training I provide are not a substitute for therapy within the medical care system. If there are important medical details that could affect a program at Zitten met Jezelf, I ask you to indicate this at the beginning of the program. You are responsible for deciding whether or not to share this information and understand the potential consequences. You are also responsible for contacting medical professionals if necessary during our contact period. That being said, I will do everything in my power to guide you as professionally as possible with the norms and values ​​I have learned within my role as a psychologist in the GGZ. Read more about this in the section on confidentiality and liability.

2.5 Confidentiality
For a Coach or Trainer, there is no legal protocol or regulation regarding professional secrecy. However, it is extremely important to me that you feel safe during our conversations and that you can trust in my confidentiality. For this reason, I still adhere, albeit unofficially, to the medical professional secrecy of Psychologists. This applies regardless of which professional role I am in conversation with you (providing information, coaching, training, etc.). Below, I explain what this professional secrecy entails.
All our conversations are confidential. This means that I will never share your personal information with others without your permission. The only exception to the above is if (based on my professional knowledge and experience, I assess that) it is a potentially life-threatening situation. In that case, I feel obligated to involve assistance or the police. When I deem it possible (without increasing the risk of life-threatening situations), I will inform you of my intention to share personal information before actually doing so. I will always notify you first of my intention to share personal information before sharing it with the above-mentioned authorities. Furthermore, it may be that I consult with others so that I can better perform my work (think of intervision/supervision/intercollegiate consultation). However, this will always be completely anonymous, in a way that the data I share cannot be traced back to you. I do not maintain a file, and I do not create an official report of our conversations. The completed questionnaires and personal data you provide to me remain within the (digital) walls of Zitten met Jezelf and within the secure online platforms we use to communicate (Google, Microsoft, Facebook, etc.). If we know each other personally, I will ensure that I make agreements with you about how we will interact if we encounter each other outside of our sessions.




3. General information Zitten met Jezelf

For both the products and programs I offer, the following conditions apply:

3.1 Intellectual Property
Virtually everything on my website or digitally sent to you upon purchase of your product or program has been created by myself. It has involved a great deal of love, time, and energy and has been done with the best intentions: to provide you as a customer/participant/human being with that extra bit of insight and clarity, so that you understand the material well and so that it can genuinely help you move forward. Although I am a strong advocate for sharing intellectual property, I find it important that this is done in consultation with me and with proper credits given. Therefore, all rights to intellectual property, such as patent rights, copyright, design rights, and other forms of rights, for all products and programs that I offer via zittenmetjezelf.nl or through other means (whether for sale or not, sold or unsold), shall at all times exclusively remain with me. The public disclosure, personal sharing with others, or commercial use of my products is only permitted with my explicit written consent. This includes documenting and agreeing on matters in writing. For example: which component is being used, the purpose or intention of the use, where it will be deployed, and any (financial) compensation. This written consent only applies within the parameters that we have agreed upon: for example, if you want to use a component in a presentation or course for your team, it may only be used for that purpose. If you wish to use the same for other purposes or within a different setting, new agreements must be made with me.
That being said, I am happy to share my creations in any form, so if you are interested, you can contact me via info@zittenmetjezelf.nl.

3.2 Liability and Complaints
The primary reason I do this work is to help people. However, it may happen that you are dissatisfied with the service I provide. In that case, I hope that we can first discuss this with each other. I will do everything I can to help you with your complaint. If this ultimately does not suffice, it is good to know what your rights are. I refer below to an 'accepted assignment', by which I mean a product or program from Zitten met Jezelf that meets the following two conditions: 1) the product or program has been paid for by you and 2) confirmed by me via email.
For accepted assignments, the following liability applies: I am not liable for any damage, of any kind whatsoever, arising from and/or during the use of the products and programs that I provide. This also applies to the quality and consequences of the delivered products and programs. Furthermore, the liability is limited to the price you paid for the product or program. Apart from the accepted assignments, I am not liable. If you wish to file a complaint, you can do so via info@zittenmetjezelf.nl. The complaint must be sent by email within one month after the conclusion of our treatment contact. I aim to handle your complaint within one month and respond to it. This is an aim and not a binding timeframe. Filing this complaint does not release you from your payment obligation to me.

3.3 Effects of Zitten met Jezelf
Each session or online exercise requires several hours to sometimes even months to integrate. Additionally, you may notice that your symptoms seem to worsen in the beginning. Don't be alarmed! This is related to the increased awareness that the sessions or exercises can bring about. The physical or emotional effects of your symptoms may become more noticeable due to mindfulness practice and/or discussing them. This is a very normal process and is part of processing your symptoms. There is a high likelihood that the underlying causes of the symptoms were already present, but they were not immediately noticeable. Or perhaps you didn't relate these feelings to the symptoms themselves. If you are actively engaged in a program with me, I recommend sharing your concerns with me. Hopefully, I can reassure you and brainstorm with you. If not, I recommend reporting the symptoms to your general practitioner or specialist. In both cases, if you are excessively worried about the symptoms, it is best to contact your general practitioner or the nearest medical center for advice as soon as possible.

3.4 Applicable Law
If a provision of these general terms and conditions is void or removed, the other provisions remain fully applicable. In place of the nullified or removed provision, you and I will draft a new provision in written consultation that should use the purpose and scope of the original provision as much as possible. The general terms and conditions remain in force if I change my company name, legal form, or make other changes to Zitten met Jezelf. Dutch law applies to the general terms and conditions.

3.5 Finally
Thank you for reading the general terms and conditions. I understand that it may not be the most enjoyable way to spend your time. However, I hope you now feel well-informed and have a clear understanding of your rights and obligations when purchasing a program or product from Zitten met Jezelf. It remains for me to thank you for your interest in Zitten met Jezelf, and I wish you much joy, insight, and happiness on the path of self-development that you are embarking on.
