###### ACT (coaching & therapy) ######
Focuses on strengthening your resilience and emphasizes behavioral change. Unlike traditional therapy, we do not just talk, we also do experiential exercises. It's likely that you'll experience more emotions in the initial phase. I'll teach you emotion regulation skills so you can transform these feelings into meaningful behavior. This process takes time. ACT evidenced-based treatment protocols for anxiety and mood disorders typically range from 12 to 20 sessions excluding intake, depending on the severity of the issues [1][2]. For optimal results, I recommend an intake session prior to weekly sessions in the initial phase. During the optional common thread sessions, you will map your lifehistory under the guidance of teacher, author and coach Mischa Klerks. If you find it all a bit daunting, you could start with the introduction package.
###### Choose ACT if you want to make significant progress, understand yourself and be more happy. ######
