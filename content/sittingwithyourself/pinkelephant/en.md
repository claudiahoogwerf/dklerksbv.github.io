Close your eyes, and try to not think about a pink elephant for one minute.
You can think about anything, except a pink elephant. Set a timer and try it out....
You will experience the effect of this exercise immediately. If you try to not think about a pink elephant you actually will think about a pink elephant!
That's why with ACT you will not work on the content of the thoughts but on the relationship you have with these thoughts.
