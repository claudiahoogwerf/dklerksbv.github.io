Buddha literally means 'the one who has awakened': awakened from the illusion that happiness is to be found outside of us<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#bassie10" id="adriaan10">[10]</a></sup>. You often hear people say that they find happiness in the 'little things'. Obviously, there is no real share of happiness in those 'little things' that you in turn can extract (otherwise they would always make you happy). Happiness is hidden behind the attention you give to things. The attention comes from your consciousness, and the nature of your consciousness is happy and loving. This is true no matter who you are or what you've been through in life<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#bassie11" id="adriaan11">[11]</a></sup>. The traditional psychologist aims to heal people. This implies that you are broken and that your happiness lies in someone else's hands. I see my role as that of an optician. The optician doesn't change anything about the person. He only provides the right tools to see clearly again (glasses, lenses, etc.).  It is my job to train your mental skills so you are able to do just that. In addition to ACT and traditional mindfulness, I use a method that combines grounding (western psychology) with non-doing (eastern spirituality). Learn more about this method in the [Sitting with Yourself introduction-series](https://dklerksbv.github.io/blog.html?lang=nl). I teach you to look through the lens of consciousness so you can discover that happiness is always within reach. Sit with Yourself is therefore an investment that you will continue to benefit from for a lifetime to come.

       'Budh' literally means 'to wake up,' and 'dha' is a suffix from Sanskrit, turning it into a past participle. According to the story, it was after a long session of meditation under the Bodhi tree that Buddha came to a profound insight. The insight that everything is constantly changing and that suffering arises when one tries to evoke, avoid, or cling to feelings. Somewhat ironically, this insight led him to an unchanging state of mindfulness, where he still experienced changing feelings but could now be completely 'happy' with them. That is to say, there was such an extreme level of acceptance and awareness that there was no more resistance, only love for what is. This is the kind of happiness that comes from within, and I speak from experience when I say that it is indescribably more powerful than the short-term happiness that most people seek.

       I explain this using the metaphor of the blue sky. In this metaphor, the blue sky symbolizes our consciousness, and the various weather conditions represent different types of thoughts and emotions that can come and go. Regardless of the weather (sun, clouds, rain, thunder, storm, fog, etc.), the blue sky always has room for it. Have you ever flown up in an aeroplane during bad weather? The blue sky is always accessible. The blue sky remains untouched by the different weather conditions, no matter how intense they may be. Regardless of what you have experienced in your life, you possess a consciousness that works in a similar way to the blue sky. Of course, there are significant differences between individuals in the types of weather that frequently appear. Certainly, genetics and learning experiences greatly influence our internal weather. However, consciousness works the same way for everyone: Out of unconditional love for anything that may come.<a href="#adriaan11" class="footnote-backref">↩</a>
