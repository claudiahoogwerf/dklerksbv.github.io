#### The Window of Mindfulness

The goal of the upcoming two blogs is primarily to ensure that you experience meditation as it should be: easy and effective. In this blog, I introduce the Window of Mindfulness, and in the next one, the Mindfulness Cheatsheet. You can think of both of them as manuals for the brain during challenging situations in meditation and daily life. Although this two-part guide has not yet been researched for effectiveness, it originated from the extensively studied and widely used psychological model: the Window of Tolerance <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#affn1" id="affnref1">[1]</a></sup>. I have simply applied the model to previously unexplored terrain, namely mindfulness and meditation. 

I previously mentioned that we cannot force a state of mindfulness. However, we do seem to have some control over the situation (where, why, when, and especially how we meditate). The situation is crucial for the probability of mindfulness and determines the effectiveness of the meditation. Opinions about the ideal situation vary, but a recurring theme is finding a balance between activity and relaxation. The Window of Tolerance precisely addresses this. It is a well-known model in psychology used for emotion regulation. Look at the image now. What you see is the original Window of Tolerance, to which I've added three small components in the middle: the Window of Mindfulness, subtle overstimulation, and understimulation. 

The Window of Tolerance is a biopsychosocial model that distinguishes three states of functioning: Hyperarousal, hypoarousal, and the in-between called the Window of Tolerance (Orange in the model). This state is where you function best: there is an optimal level of tension in your body (arousal), allowing you to concentrate, learn, receive information clearly and feel your basic needs.
However, when the body detects danger or stress, it activates the sympathetic nervous system to put you in a fight or flight mode. This leads to accelerated breathing, heart rate, and an alert mind. There is an excess of tension in your body (hyperarousal), often accompanied by overstimulation in the mind (red in the model). Fleeting thoughts, scattered thinking, and rumination are daily symptoms of hyperarousal<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#affn2" id="affnref2">[2]</a></sup>. When tension further increases, it can result in panic attacks, anger bursts, uncontrollable crying, or psychotic symptoms.

Normally, when the body is tired, it activates the parasympathetic nervous system, which in turn causes relaxation. This is accompanied by slowed breathing, heart rate, and a drowsy mind. This state represents a shortage of tension in your body (hypoarousal), often accompanied by understimulation in the mind (blue in the model). The moment just before falling asleep is a typical moment of hypoarousal. The freeze reaction (freezing) is also part of this model: your system shuts down in self-defense when overwhelmed by stress. In our relatively overstimulating society, we increasingly see people in a state of prolonged hyperarousal (literally burnout), depleting their energy reserves. Comparable to hibernation in the animal world, the body shuts down in stressful periods to rebuild depleted reserves. More severe cases of understimulation include burnout, depression, feelings of emptiness, blackout, and dissociation. 

Okay! But what does emotion regulation have to do with meditation? Well, the knowledge we have about emotion regulation can be used for more effective meditations. Emotion regulation works like this: when you are overstimulated, you use relaxation techniques and when you are understimulated, you use activation techniques. This way, you bring yourself back into the Window of Tolerance <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#affn3" id="affnref3">[3]</a></sup>. This is also known as grounding <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#affn4" id="affnref4">[4]</a></sup>.

In a subtle way, we can see these three states in our meditations. Although we often find ourselves within the window of tolerance when meditating, there are often hints of subtle understimulation and overstimulation. When we learn to recognize this, we can respond to it effectively. We can use techniques to further regulate our body and mind. When we are within our Window of Tolerance and there is a perfect balance between activation and relaxation, we are in the area where everyone wants to be: not only are we highly resilient to challenging situations, but there is also an optimal situation for mindfulness to arise. This is what I call the Window of Mindfulness. In the next blog, I will explain some techniques that can help you get there using the Mindfulness Cheatsheet.
