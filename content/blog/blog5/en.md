#### The Direct Approach

In everyday life, we are so accustomed to being busy that we often no longer know how to do otherwise. Even when we're sitting on the couch, telling ourselves, 'Now, I'm going to do absolutely nothing,' our minds often do the opposite. When I ask people what they mean by doing nothing, they give answers like watching series, walking, reading, using social media, crafting, cooking, drawing, (progressive) mindfulness, or yoga. Although many of these activities may require less brain energy than many daily tasks, they are by no means doing nothing. Doing nothing is an art, and it is certainly not easy. Doing nothing is also called the 'being mode' and is central to the Direct Approach that I will explain in this final blog of the introduction-series:  

Most psychological, spiritual and religious approaches are progressive rather than direct. The premise is self-development, and the method involves working now so that you can reap the benefits in the future. Common forms of therapy fall into this category, where you receive a diagnosis and then undergo treatment to work so that you will be 'healed' in the future. Common forms of meditation also fall into this category, where you train concentration, love or wisdom so that in the future there will be more happiness and less suffering. Don't get me wrong: setting goals and attempting to achieve them is an effective way to deal with life, and there's nothing wrong with that. However, the problem is that this approach can make you overlook the most important thing: the present moment. This form of avoidance can be very subtle. When you say to yourself, 'I have to focus on my breathing,' you are subtly telling yourself that anything else is not welcome. The progressive approach indirectly suggests that the present moment is not good enough and maybe  that you are not good enough. It indirectly tells you that you have to work very hard to solve that problem. 

The Direct Approach is radically different from those progressive approaches: You are perfect as you are, and this moment is perfect as it is. But you may not be able to see that yet because the autopilot has taken over largely. When you completely stop doing things (both in physical behavior and in your thoughts), you enter the 'being mode', the natural state of consciousness. 

So, how can you experience something like this? In previous blogs, we have explored mindfulness and meditation, and I hope the two-step plan of grounding is clear to you by now. When you enter the Window of Mindfulness, the instruction is to let go of control. That means: Stop trying to influence your meditation, stop directing your attention, stop analyzing, stop trying to solve your problems, and stop wondering if you're doing it right. Now, look at the image accompanying this blog. An ancient but vividly alive Buddhist monk sang the following mantra during our guided meditations in Malaysia: "accept all things: don't reject, follow, or ignore." In one sentence, he explained what radical acceptance is. Radical acceptance is to stop avoiding negative experiences, stop seeking positive experiences, and stop ignoring all other experiences. As you may recall from blog 1, this method is completely opposite to the tasks of the autopilot. Within the Direct Approach, this is called 'non-doing,'. Our brain finds this quite difficult because we are so used to always being busy. An easier synonym for non-doing is resting. Resting with all that is. Lean back into your world of experience and see everything come and go by itself, without your interference.

When you try this during meditation, after a while, you may notice something strange happening: your world of experience suddenly becomes extremely clear and conscious, thoughts decrease or disappear, your sense of time and space seems gone, and the experience of yourself and the world merge into a whole <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#bffn1" id="bffnref1">[1]</a></sup>. Such an initial experience is often called 'waking up'<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#bffn2" id="bffnref2">[2]</a></sup>  and these kinds of experiences can completely turn your life upside down. It's as if you were living in a dream until then (the autopilot was in control), and now you see things as they really are. And that is terribly liberating. Suddenly you understand why it always felt like something was wrong, like something was missing in your life. You realize that this all has to do with perspective: Instead of 'I have to achieve this and that to be good enough,' you realize 'this moment is perfect as it is, I am perfect as I am.' If you decide to practice this, expect that it may change a lot in your life. You will be less and less controlled by the autopilot, making your values clearer than ever. And that can clash with the way you are used to living and/or evoke existential fears. If you decide to practice this without guidance and get stuck in the process: There are plenty of coaches, psychologists and meditators who have gone through a similar process and can help you get through it<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#bffn3" id="bffnref3">[3]</a></sup>. So, don't hesitate to seek help. 

In a similar manner to the two-step plan, the method of Sit with Yourself can be briefly summarized: first grounding, then non-doing. Of all the knowledge and experience I have gained from psychology and mindfulness traditions, this is the most significant pattern-disrupter I know. This is because it sheds light on our essence, on who we are at our core <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#bffn4" id="bffnref4">[4]</a></sup>. This transformation has happened to me, and it has happened to many others who walked the path of mindfulness. I understand that all this may sound a bit to good to be real. So if you feel any resistance,  I see where you're coming from. I can only emphasize that regardless of whether you choose to work with me or not: go for it! You will be immensely grateful to yourself for embarking on this journey. However you see it, if your curiosity has led you to this site, then the seed has long been planted, and likely, the plant is already growing: The process of 'waking up' is already underway, and your life will naturally unfold. You can trust in that. 

This concludes the last blog of this introductory-series. I hope that the information can contribute to your process, and I wish you an abundance of love, happiness, and wisdom.

         Similar experiences can also arise outside of meditation. However, awareness is often less clear, and costs can be high. Consider extreme performances (e.g., top athletes, surgeons in the operating room, mountain climbers without safety nets, etc.), mind-altering substances (especially psychedelics), sexual activities (e.g., during orgasms and non-vanilla sex), or in the presence of extreme beauty (e.g., nature, music, art, and love). </sup><a href="#cffnref1" class="footnote-backref">↩</a>

         Literally translated, Buddha means 'the one who has awakened.' According to the story, Buddha 'awakened' under the Bodhi tree, but unlike most people who undergo such an experience, he remained 'awake' (enlightened; Eckhart Tolle also tells a similar story, where he says he was permanently awakened during his first experience). However, for the vast majority of people, the autopilot takes over fairly quickly after such an experience. The first time often feels very special (some people may experience strongly positive physical or mental sensations), but you will notice that the more often you have such an experience, the more normal it becomes for you. Nevertheless, the impact of these experiences on your life remain groundbreaking. </sup><a href="#cffnref1" class="footnote-backref">↩</a>
