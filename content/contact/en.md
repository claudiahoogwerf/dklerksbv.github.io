## Contact & Availability

Great, you made it to the contactpage! You're just one step away from starting your journey with Sitting with Yourself (Zitten met Jezelf). I'm looking forward to working with you! Feel free to get in touch if you have any questions, want to get acquainted, or if you're interested in booking a single session or a package.

I'm quickest to reach via email, whatsapp, or with the contact form (click on my email address), or if you prefer to call: If I don't answer, please send me a message so I can call you back as soon as possible.
Currently, there are still a few spots available for individual ACT coaching or individual mindfulness training. The mindfulness group training and download packages are not available at the moment, but send me a message so I can add you to the list of interested individuals.

Sessions are available face to face (in the Amsterdam region) or via video call (anywhere in the world). If you choose face-to-face sessions, it's important to note that I currently do not have an office space. Therefore, these meetings can either take place in your own home or in a public place. Any travel costs will be discussed and agreed upon together.
